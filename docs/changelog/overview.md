# Release Notes Overview

This section provides an overview of release notes for all eBay APIs documented on this site. Here 
you can browse recent changes, updates, and announcements across the entire eBay API platform in one 
place.

Please note that the release notes shown here may not always reflect the very latest changes 
published by eBay. While this documentation is updated regularly, there can be a delay between an 
official eBay release and its appearance on this site.

To stay fully up to date, we recommend subscribing to our Atom, RSS, or JSON release note feeds. 
These feeds are updated automatically and deliver new release notes as soon as they are detected.

For more information on available feeds and customization options, see [Release Feeds](/changelog/feeds).

> [!CAUTION]
> Not every API change is immediately available in the SDK documented on this site. Some updates may 
> require SDK changes or may only apply to newer API versions. Always refer to the supported API 
> version number displayed on each individual documentation page here to determine which API version 
> is currently supported by this SDK.
