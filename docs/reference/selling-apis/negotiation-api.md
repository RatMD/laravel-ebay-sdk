# Negotiation API <DocsBadge path="sell/negotiation/static/overview.html" />

> [!CAUTION]
> This API has not yet been implemented yet.

The Negotiation API gives sellers the ability to engage in sales negotiations with buyers.

The API currently supports only the ability for sellers to extend offers to buyers who have shown 
an interest in their listings. The ability to partake in more detailed negotiations will increase 
as the functionality of the API is expanded.
