# Catalog API <DocsBadge path="sell/catalog/overview.html" />

> [!CAUTION]
> This API has not yet been implemented yet.

The Catalog API allows users to search for and locate an eBay catalog product that is a direct match 
for the product that they wish to sell. Listing against an eBay catalog product helps insure that 
all listings (based off of that catalog product) have complete and accurate information. Buyers are 
then able to compare 'apples to apples', and base their purchasing decisions on real differences 
between listings, such as price, shipping cost, and any item promotions.

In addition to helping to create high-quality listings, another benefit to the seller of using 
catalog information to create listings is that much of the details of the listing will be prefilled, 
including the listing title, the listing description, the item specifics, and a stock image for the 
product (if available). Sellers will not have to enter item specifics themselves, and the overall 
listing process is a lot faster and easier.

For more information about finding eBay catalog products and using these products to list, see 
Matching inventory to catalog products in the Selling Integration Guide.
