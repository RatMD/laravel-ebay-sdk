# Taxonomy API <DocsBadge path="sell/taxonomy/overview.html" />

> [!CAUTION]
> This API has not yet been implemented yet.

The Taxonomy API enables you to assist both sellers and buyers:

- It helps sellers to determine the best eBay category under which to offer each inventory item for 
sale in a selected eBay marketplace. It helps sellers to select the categories of items to include 
in a campaign or promotion. It also provides information about the aspects to include when defining 
an inventory item in a given category. For more information, see the Selling Integration Guide.
- It helps buyers to determine the appropriate categories in which to browse or search for the items 
they're looking to purchase in a particular eBay marketplace. For more information, see the Buying 
Integration Guide.
