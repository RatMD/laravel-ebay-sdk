> [!CAUTION]
> This API has not yet been implemented yet.

The Leads API lets sellers return leads generated by their Classified Ad and includes any contact 
information that prospective buyers have submitted. A seller can retrieve leads for items listed 
under their own seller account for a specified marketplace optionally filtered by specified search 
criteria. Use this resource to retrieve sales-lead information for lead-generating classified ad 
listings.
