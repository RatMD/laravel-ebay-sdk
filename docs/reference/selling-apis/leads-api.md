# Leads API <Badge type="warning" style="margin-left:0.75rem;">v1.0.0</Badge> <DocsBadge path="sell/leads/overview.html" />

The Leads API lets sellers return leads generated by their Classified Ad and includes any contact 
information that prospective buyers have submitted. A seller can retrieve leads for items listed 
under their own seller account for a specified marketplace optionally filtered by specified search 
criteria. Use this resource to retrieve sales-lead information for lead-generating classified ad 
listings.

those matching specified filter criteria can be returned.
