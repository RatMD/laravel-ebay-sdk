# Recommendation API <DocsBadge path="sell/recommendation/static/overview.html" />

> [!CAUTION]
> This API has not yet been implemented yet.

The Recommendation API returns information that sellers can use to configure Promoted Listings ad 
campaigns.

> [!NOTE]
> The Recommendation API only applies to general strategy campaigns that use the Cost Per Sale (CPS) 
> funding model; it does not apply to priority strategy campaigns that use the Cost Per Click (CPC) 
> funding model.

The Recommendation API currently has a single recommendation type, AD, that returns information 
pertaining to Promoted Listings ad campaigns. Seller can use the recommendations returned as 
guidelines for setting up campaigns.

In the eBay marketplace, where an increased visibility directly correlates to the buyer conversion 
rate, information returned with the AD recommendation type can help you know which listings to 
promote and how to configure ad campaigns.
