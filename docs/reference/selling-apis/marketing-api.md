# Marketing API <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/static/overview.html" />

> [!CAUTION]
> This API has not yet been implemented yet.

The Marketing API supports three eBay marketing features - Promoted Listings, Promotions Manager, 
and Store Email Campaigns. Used separately or together, these three marketing features can increase 
views and sales of the seller's items.

**Promoted Listings** is an eBay advertising service that increases the visibility of items included 
in a seller's ad campaigns. For more information on Promoted Listings, see the Promoted Listings 
Playbook.

**Discounts manager** is a free service that gives sellers the ability to offer price discounts on 
their items. For more information on Discounts manager, see the Discounts Manager section of the 
Selling Integration Guide.

**Email Store Campaigns** allow eBay store sellers to create and send email campaigns to subscribers, 
followers, and past customers who’ve signed up to receive newsletters from a seller’s store. For 
more information on email campaigns, see the Store Email Campaigns section of the Selling 
Integration Guide.

> [!NOTE]
> The Marketing API works with listings that have been created with the Trading API as well as 
> listings that are managed with the Inventory API.
