# Marketing API <Badge type="warning" style="margin-left:0.75rem;">v1.22.3</Badge> <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/static/overview.html" />

The Marketing API supports three eBay marketing features - Promoted Listings, Promotions Manager, 
and Store Email Campaigns. Used separately or together, these three marketing features can increase 
views and sales of the seller's items.

**Promoted Listings** is an eBay advertising service that increases the visibility of items included 
in a seller's ad campaigns. For more information on Promoted Listings, see the Promoted Listings 
Playbook.

**Discounts manager** is a free service that gives sellers the ability to offer price discounts on 
their items. For more information on Discounts manager, see the Discounts Manager section of the 
Selling Integration Guide.

**Email Store Campaigns** allow eBay store sellers to create and send email campaigns to subscribers, 
followers, and past customers who’ve signed up to receive newsletters from a seller’s store. For 
more information on email campaigns, see the Store Email Campaigns section of the Selling 
Integration Guide.

> [!NOTE]
> The Marketing API works with listings that have been created with the Trading API as well as 
> listings that are managed with the Inventory API.

## Ad

### BulkCreateAdsByInventoryReference <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/ad/methods/bulkCreateAdsByInventoryReference" />

<ResourcePath method="POST">/ad_campaign/{campaignId}/bulk_create_ads_by_inventory_reference</ResourcePath>

This method adds multiple listings that are managed with the Inventory API to an existing Promoted 
Listings campaign.

For general strategy campaigns using the Cost Per Sale (CPS) model, bulk ads may be directly created 
for the listing.

For each listing specified in the request, this method:

- Creates an ad for the listing.
- Sets the bid percentage (also known as the ad rate) for the ads created.
- Associates the ads created with the specified campaign.

To create ads for a listing, specify their inventoryReferenceId and inventoryReferenceType, plus the 
bidPercentage for the ad in the payload of the request. Specify the campaign to which you want to 
associate the ads using the campaign_id path parameter.

> This method only applies to the Cost Per Sale (CPS) funding model; it does not apply to the Cost 
> Per Click (CPC) funding model.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\Ad\BulkCreateAdsByInventoryReference;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new BulkCreateAdsByInventoryReference(

50,000 items. Be aware when using this call that each variation in a multiple-variation listing 
creates an individual ad.

For manual targeting priority strategy campaigns using the Cost Per Click (CPC) funding model, an ad 
group must be created first. If no ad group has been created for the campaign, ads cannot be created.

## AdReportTask 

### CreateReportTask <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/ad_report_task/methods/CreateReportTask" />

<ResourcePath method="POST">/ad_report_task</ResourcePath>

This method creates a report task, which generates a Promoted Listings report based on the values 
specified in the call.

The report is generated based on the criteria you specify, including the report type, the report's 
dimensions and metrics, the report's start and end dates, the listings to include in the report, and 
more. Metrics are the quantitative measurements in the report while dimensions specify the 
attributes of the data included in the reports.

When creating a report task, you can specify the items you want included in the report. The items 
you specify, using either listingId or inventoryReference values, must be in a Promoted Listings 
campaign for them to be included in the report.

For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see 
[Promoted Listings reporting](https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/pl-reports.html).

This call returns the URL to the report task in the Location response header, and the URL includes 
the report-task ID.

Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of 202, 
which indicates the report is being generated. Call getReportTasks (or getReportTask with the 
report-task ID) to determine the status of a Promoted Listings report. When a report is complete, 
eBay sets its status to SUCCESS and you can download it using the URL returned in the reportHref 
field of the getReportTask call. Report files are tab-separated value gzip files with a file 
extension of .tsv.gz.

A Promoted Listings campaign is the structure in which you place the ads or ad group for the 
listings you wish to promote.

> [!NOTE]
> Campaigns can only contain ads for a maximum of 50,000 items.

General strategy campaigns utilize a Cost Per Sale (CPS) funding model. Sellers can set the ad rate
and bidding strategies that are right for their business through the adRateStrategy, 
biddingStrategy, bidPercentage fields. For more information on general strategy campaigns, see 
Promoted Listings general strategy campaign flow.

Priority strategy campaigns utilize a Cost per Click (CPC) funding model. Sellers can create a daily 
budget through the budget container and choose what channel that their ads appear on. In addition, 
priority strategy campaigns give sellers the ability to create ad groups and specify keywords to 
ensure their ads reach their intended audience. For more information on priority strategy campaigns, 
see Promoted listings priority strategy campaign flow.

Promoted Offsite campaigns give sellers the ability to create their own advertising campaign and 
promote their eBay listing in leading external search channels. For more information on Promoted 
Offsite campaigns, see Promoted Offsite.

### SetupQuickCampaign <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/campaign/methods/setupQuickCampaign" />

<ResourcePath method="POST">/ad_campaign/setup_quick_campaign</ResourcePath>

This method allows the seller to expedite the creation of a priority strategy campaign.

Sellers only need to provide basic campaign information, such as the user-defined campaign name, the 
start date (and optionally the end date) of the campaign, the daily budget amount of the campaign, 
and the eBay marketplace where the campaign will be hosted. The seller must also identify the items 
they want to place in the campaign by adding the listing id of each item in the listingIds array of 
the request.

Using the provided listingIds, eBay creates ad groups for the campaign and organizes the listings 
into the appropriate ad group. eBay then adds keywords to each ad group and assigns each keyword a 
suggested bid.

By default, campaigns created using setupQuickCampaign utilize a FIXED keyword bidding strategy 
which means that a seller manually assigns and adjusts keyword bids for their CPC campaign.

Alternatively, once the campaign has been created, sellers may opt to utilize a DYNAMIC bidding 
strategy which means that eBay will manage a campaign's keyword bids and automatically update them 
daily to the suggested bid.

For additional information about FIXED and DYNAMIC bidding strategies, refer to 
updateBiddingStrategy.

Campaigns created using this method will be in DRAFT status upon creation.

The location response header returned contains the getCampaign URI to retrieve the newly created 
campaign that is in draft status. Sellers should make this call to review and approve the campaign 
before they use the launchCampaign method to start the campaign.

> [!NOTE]
> General strategy ad campaigns are not supported.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\Campaign\SetupQuickCampaign;

### UpdateBiddingStrategy <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/campaign/methods/updateBiddingStrategy" />

<ResourcePath method="POST">/ad_campaign/{campaignId}/update_bidding_strategy</ResourcePath>

This method allows sellers to change the bidding strategy for a specified Cost Per Click (CPC) 
campaign that uses manual targeting. Available bidding strategies are:

- `FIXED`  
  When using a fixed bidding strategy, sellers manually assign and adjust keyword bids for the CPC 
  campaign.
- `DYNAMIC`  
  When using a dynamic bidding strategy, eBay will manage a campaign's keyword bids and 
  automatically update them daily to the suggested bid.

> [!NOTE]
> For a CPC campaign using dynamic bidding, sellers can continue to manually add keywords for the 
> campaign, but they are no longer able to manually adjust their associated bid values. In order to 
> manually adjust bid values, sellers must use the FIXED bidding strategy.

In addition, this method allows sellers to modify the maxCPC value of a smart targeting campaign.

> [!NOTE]
> This method only applies to the Cost Per Click (CPC) funding model; it does not apply to the Cost 
> Per Sale (CPS) funding model.

< strategy program. For information about how to request access to this program, refer to Priority 
> Strategy Access Requests in the Promoted Listings Playbook. To determine if a seller qualifies for 
> priority strategy, use the getAdvertisingEligibility method in Account API.

This method updates the daily budget for a priority strategy campaign that uses the Cost Per Click 
(CPC) funding model.

A click occurs when an eBay user finds and clicks on the seller’s listing (within the search 
results) after using a keyword that the seller has created for the campaign. For each ad in an ad 
group in the campaign, each click triggers a cost, which gets subtracted from the campaign’s daily 
budget. If the cost of the clicks exceeds the daily budget, the Promoted Listings campaign will be 
paused until the next day.

Specify the campaign_id as a path parameter. You can retrieve the campaign IDs for a seller by 
calling the getCampaigns method.

> [!NOTE]
> The daily budget for a campaign can only be updated 15 times per day. If this limit is exceeded, 
> an error will occur and you will be blocked from updating the budget until the next day.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\Campaign\UpdateCampaignStrategy;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new UpdateCampaignStrategy(
    campaignId: (string) $campaignId,

### UpdateCampaignIdentification <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/campaign/methods/updateCampaignIdentification" />

<ResourcePath method="POST">/ad_campaign/{campaignId}/update_campaign_identification</ResourcePath>

This method can be used to change the name of a campaign, as well as modify the start or end dates.
Specify the campaign_id you want to update as a URI parameter, and configure the campaignName and 
startDate in the request payload.

If you want to change only the end date of the campaign, specify the current campaign name, set 
endDate as desired, and set startDate to the actual start date of the campaign. This applies if the
campaign status is RUNNING or PAUSED. You can retrieve the startDate using the getCampaign method.

Note that if you do not set a new end date in this call, any current endDate value will be set to 
null. To preserve the currently-set end date, you must specify the value again in your request.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\Campaign\UpdateCampaignIdentification;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new UpdateCampaignIdentification(
    campaignId: (string) $campaignId,

### CreateItemPriceMarkdownPromotion <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/item_price_markdown/methods/createItemPriceMarkdownPromotion" />

<ResourcePath method="POST">/item_price_markdown</ResourcePath>

This method creates an item price markdown discount (know simply as a "markdown discount") where a 
discount amount is applied directly to the items included in the discount. Discounts can be 
specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights 
discounted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows.

Unlike an item discount, a markdown discount does not require the buyer meet a "threshold" before 
the offer takes effect. With markdown discounts, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to 
receive the discount benefit.

> [!CAUTION]
> There are some restrictions for which listings are available for price markdown discounts. For 
> details, see Discounts Manager requirements and restrictions.
>   
> In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your 
> markdown discounts. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the Growth tab in Seller 
> Hub.

There are two ways to enable items for markdown discounts:

- **Key-based discounts** select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of 
  the items you want to discount. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify 
  both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to 
  include.
- **Rule-based discounts** select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category 
  IDs. Rules can further constrain items being discounted by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and 
  item conditions.

New discounts must be created in either a DRAFT or a SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you 
are initially creating a discount and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before 
scheduling it to run. When you create a discount, the promotionId is returned in the Location
response header. Use this ID to reference the discount in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a 
discount that's in a DRAFT state).

> [!TIP]
> Refer to Discounts Manager in the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how 
> to create and manage seller discounts.

Markdown discounts are available on all eBay marketplaces. For more information, see Discounts 
Manager requirements and restrictions.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\ItemPriceMarkdown\CreateItemPriceMarkdownPromotion;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new CreateItemPriceMarkdownPromotion(
    payload: (array) $payload,
);
$response = $client->execute($request);
```

### DeleteItemPriceMarkdownPromotion <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/item_price_markdown/methods/deleteItemPriceMarkdownPromotion" />

<ResourcePath method="DELETE">/item_price_markdown/{promotionId}</ResourcePath>

This method deletes the item price markdown discount specified by the promotion_id path parameter. 
Call getPromotions to retrieve the IDs of a seller's discounts.

You can delete any discount with the exception of those that are currently active (RUNNING). To end 
a running discount, call updateItemPriceMarkdownPromotion and adjust the endDate field as 
appropriate.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\ItemPriceMarkdown\DeleteItemPriceMarkdownPromotion;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new DeleteItemPriceMarkdownPromotion(
    promotionId: (string) $promotionId,
);
$response = $client->execute($request);
```

### GetItemPriceMarkdownPromotion <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/item_price_markdown/methods/getItemPriceMarkdownPromotion" />

<ResourcePath method="GET">/item_price_markdown/{promotionId}</ResourcePath>

This method returns the complete details of the item price markdown discounnt that's indicated by 
the promotion_id path parameter.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\ItemPriceMarkdown\GetItemPriceMarkdownPromotion;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new GetItemPriceMarkdownPromotion(
    promotionId: (string) $promotionId,
);
$response = $client->execute($request);
```

### UpdateItemPriceMarkdownPromotion <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/item_price_markdown/methods/updateItemPriceMarkdownPromotion" />

<ResourcePath method="PUT">/item_price_markdown/{promotionId}</ResourcePath>

This method updates the specified item price markdown discount with the new configuration that you 
supply in the payload of the request. Specify the discount you want to update using the promotion_id 
path parameter. Call getPromotions to retrieve the IDs of a seller's discounts.

When updating a discount, supply all the fields that you used to configure the original discount 
(and not just the fields you are updating). eBay replaces the specified discount with the values you 
supply in the update request and if you don't pass a field that currently has a value, the update 
request fails.

The parameters you are allowed to update with this request depend on the status of the discount 
you're updating:

- `DRAFT` or `SCHEDULED` discounts: You can update any of the parameters in these discounts that 
  have not yet started to run, including the discountRules.
- `RUNNING` discounts: You can change the endDate and the item's inventory but you cannot change the 
  discount or the start date.
- `ENDED` discounts: Nothing can be changed.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\ItemPriceMarkdown\UpdateItemPriceMarkdownPromotion;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new UpdateItemPriceMarkdownPromotion(
    promotionId: (string) $promotionId,
    payload: (array) $payload
);
$response = $client->execute($request);
```

## ItemPromotion

> [!NOTE] 
> As of July 8th 2024, promotions are now being referred to as discounts on Seller Hub and eBay help 
> ages. Sell Marketing API documentation has been updated to reflect this product name change, but 
> note that no API interface changes have been made.

### CreateItemPromotion <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/item_promotion/methods/createItemPromotion" />

<ResourcePath method="POST">/item_promotion</ResourcePath>

This method creates an item discount, where the buyer receives a discount when they meet the 
specific buying criteria. Known here as "threshold discounts", these discounts trigger when a 
threshold is met.

eBay highlights discounted items by placing teasers for the discounted items throughout the online 
buyer flows.

`Discounts` are specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price 
of a listing, letting you offer deals such as "Buy 1 Get 1" and "Buy $50, get 20% off".

`Volume pricing` discounts increase the value of the discount as the buyer increases the quantity ´
they purchase.

`Coded Coupons` provide unique codes that a buyer can use during checkout to receive a discount. The 
seller can specify the number of times a buyer can use the coupon and the maximum amount across all 
purchases that can be discounted using the coupon. The coupon code can also be made public 
(appearing on the seller's Offer page, search pages, the item listing, and the checkout page) or 
private (only on the seller's Offer page, but the seller can include the code in email and social 
media).

> [!NOTE]
> Coded Coupons are currently available in the US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, and AU marketplaces.

There are two ways to add items to a threshold discount:

- **Key-based discounts** select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of 
  the items you want to discount. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify 
  both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want 
  to be discounted.
- **Rule-based discounts** select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category 
  IDs. Rules can further constrain the items being discounted by minimum and maximum prices, brands, 
  and item conditions.

You must create a new discount in either a DRAFT or SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you 
are initially creating a discount and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before 
scheduling it to run. When you create a discount, the promotion ID is returned in the Location 
response header. Use this ID to reference the discount in subsequent requests.

> [!TIP]
> Refer to the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how to create and manage 
> threshold discounts using the Discounts Manager.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\ItemPromotion\CreateItemPromotion;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new CreateItemPromotion(
    payload: (array) $payload,

You can delete any discount with the exception of those that are currently active (RUNNING). To end 
a running threshold discount, call updateItemPromotion and adjust the endDate field as appropriate.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\ItemPromotion\DeleteItemPromotion;

```

### UpdateItemPromotion <DocsBadge path="sell/marketing/resources/item_promotion/methods/updateItemPromotion" />

<ResourcePath method="PUT">/item_promotion/{promotionId}</ResourcePath>

This method updates the specified threshold discount with the new configuration that you supply in
the request. Indicate the discount you want to update using the promotion_id path parameter.

Call getPromotions to retrieve the IDs of a seller's discounts.

When updating a discount, supply all the fields that you used to configure the original discount 
(and not just the fields you are updating). eBay replaces the specified discount with the values you
supply in the update request and if you don't pass a field that currently has a value, the update 
request will fail.

The parameters you are allowed to update with this request depend on the status of the discount you're updating:

- `DRAFT` or `SCHEDULED` discounts: You can update any of the parameters in these discounts that 
  have not yet started to run, including the discountRules.
- `RUNNING` or `PAUSED` discounts: You can change the endDate and the item's inventory but you 
  cannot change the discount or the start date.
- `ENDED` discounts: Nothing can be changed.

> [!TIP]
> When updating a RUNNING or PAUSED discount, set the status field to SCHEDULED for the update 
> request. When the discount is updated, the previous status (either RUNNING or PAUSED) is retained.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\ItemPromotion\UpdateItemPromotion;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);

Resuming a discount reinstates the teasers and any transactions that were in motion before the 
discount was paused will again be eligible for the discount.

Pass the ID of the discount you want to resume using the promotion_id path parameter. Call 
getPromotions to retrieve the IDs of the seller's discounts.

```php
use Rat\eBaySDK\API\MarketingAPI\Promotion\ResumePromotion;
use Rat\eBaySDK\Client;

$client = app(Client::class);
$request = new ResumePromotion(
    promotionId: (string) $promotionId,
)
$response = $client->execute($request);
```
