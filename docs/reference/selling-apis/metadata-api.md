# Metadata API <DocsBadge path="sell/metadata/static/overview.html" />

> [!CAUTION]
> This API has not yet been implemented yet.

The Metadata API lets you retrieve metadata on eBay category policies, information on sales tax 
jurisdictions, and available hazardous material related label information.

Category policies are the eBay policies and guidelines for how you must list certain items in 
specific categories across the different eBay marketplaces. For example, if you are listing items 
with variations, you'll want to know which categories support multiple-variation listings. Another 
example is that you may want to know which item conditions are supported for different eBay 
categories. See Retrieve the eBay listing policies for an eBay marketplace and category ID for more 
information.

Several countries have sales tax jurisdictions where the tax rates across the different 
jurisdictions may vary. You can use the Metadata API to retrieve the lists of tax jurisdictions 
which you can then use to set up sales tax tables. See Retrieve sales tax jurisdictions for more 
information.

Sellers have the ability to add hazardous material related label information to their listings. See 
Retrieve hazardous material labels information for selling flows for more information.
