# Condition Enum <DocsBadge path="ell/inventory/types/slr:ConditionEnum" />

This enumeration type is used to indicate the condition of the item. Item conditions can vary with 
each eBay Category. For more information on item conditions, including condition ID and name values, 
see Item condition ID and name values.

| Value           | Description                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `NEW` | This enumeration value indicates that the inventory item is a brand-new, unopened item in its original packaging. This enumeration value should be used if the Condition ID value is 1000. |
| `LIKE_NEW` | This enumeration value indicates that the inventory item is in 'like-new' condition. In other words, the item has been opened, but very lightly used if used at all. This condition typically applies to books or DVDs. This enumeration value should be used if the Condition ID value is 2750. Note: This condition enumeration value should be used for trading card categories to indicate that a trading card is Graded. |
| `NEW_OTHER` | This enumeration value indicates that the inventory item is a new, unused item, but it may be missing the original packaging or perhaps not sealed. When a seller specifies this condition for an item, that seller should also provide a more detailed explanation of the item's condition in the conditionDescription field. This enumeration value should be used if the Condition ID value is 1500. |
| `NEW_WITH_DEFECTS` | This enumeration value indicates that the inventory item is a new, unused item, but it has defects. This item condition is typically applicable to clothing or shoes that may have scuffs, hanging threads, missing buttons, etc. When a seller specifies this condition for an item, that seller should also provide a more detailed explanation of the item's condition in the conditionDescription field. This enumeration value should be used if the Condition ID value is 1750. |
| `MANUFACTURER_REFURBISHED` | Important! This enumeration value should no longer be used, as the 'Manufacturer Refurbished' item condition is no longer a valid item condition on any eBay marketplace. In all eBay marketplaces, Condition ID 2000 now maps to item condition 'Certified Refurbished', and not 'Manufacturer Refurbished'. If the MANUFACTURER_REFURBISHED enum is used, it will be accepted but automatically converted by eBay to CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED. In the future, the MANUFACTURER_REFURBISHED may start triggering an error if used. |
| `CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED` | This enumeration value indicates that the inventory item is in pristine, like-new condition and has been inspected, cleaned and refurbished by the manufacturer or a manufacturer-approved vendor. The item will be in new packaging with original or new accessories. This enumeration value should be used if the Condition ID value is 2000. Note: This CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED value has replaced the deprecated MANUFACTURER_REFURBISHED value. eBay will automatically convert the condition value of existing inventory items from MANUFACTURER_REFURBISHED to CERTIFIED_REFURBISHED. Sellers must go through an application and qualification process to become eligible to list with 'Certified - Refurbished' item condition. Sellers interested in the eligibility requirements to list with 'Certified Refurbished' should see the Certified refurbished program page in Seller Center. |
| `EXCELLENT_REFURBISHED` | This enumeration value indicates that the inventory item is in like new condition and has been inspected, cleaned, and refurbished by the manufacturer or a manufacturer-approved vendor. When a seller specifies this condition for an item, that seller should also provide a more detailed explanation of the item's condition in the conditionDescription field. This enumeration value should be used if the Condition ID value is 2010. Note: This item condition is limited to a select number of eBay marketplaces and categories. See Category and marketplace support for the eBay Refurbished Program for more information. Sellers must go through an application and qualification process to become eligible to list with the 'Excellent - Refurbished' item condition. Sellers interested in the eligibility requirements to list with 'Excellent Refurbished' should see the Certified refurbished program page in Seller Center. |
| `VERY_GOOD_REFURBISHED` | This enumeration value indicates that the inventory item shows minimal wear and has been inspected, cleaned, and refurbished by the manufacturer or a manufacturer-approved vendor.
